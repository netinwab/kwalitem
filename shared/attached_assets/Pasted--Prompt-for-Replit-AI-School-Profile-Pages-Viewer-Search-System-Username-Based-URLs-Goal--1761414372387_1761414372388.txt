🧠 Prompt for Replit AI — “School Profile Pages + Viewer Search System (Username-Based URLs)”

Goal

Implement full school profile pages and a new viewer dashboard search system, where every school’s public profile link is based on its account username (not school name).
Example:

Username → albesta_admin  
URL → yearbuk.com/albesta_admin


⸻

TASK 1 — School Profile Pages

New Route

/:schoolUsername

Each school will have a unique profile page accessible via their account username.
Example:
yearbuk.com/albesta_admin

⸻

Profile Page Layout

Each school profile page should include:
	•	School logo (top-left)
	•	Cover banner
	•	School name
	•	Motto / short about section
	•	Published Yearbooks (grid view — clicking a cover opens the viewer)
	•	Memories (thumbnails if available)
	•	Buttons:
	•	“Find Yearbooks”
	•	“Request Alumni Status”

⸻

Behavior per Account Type

1️⃣ For Viewers (logged in):
	•	Can view all sections.
	•	Can click “Find Yearbooks” or “Request Alumni Status”.
	•	If verified → show alumni badge.
	•	Paid yearbooks appear normal; unpaid yearbooks are blurred.

2️⃣ For School Accounts:
	•	Can view their own profile.
	•	Show “Edit Profile” button → routes to /school-settings.
	•	Show unpublished/draft yearbooks (hidden from others).

3️⃣ For Unregistered Users:
	•	Can view only public info (logo, cover, motto, and published yearbooks).
	•	When they click anything (e.g. “Request Alumni Status”), show modal:

Meta Info

Each school page should have:
	•	Title: ${schoolName} — Yearbuk
	•	Description: ${schoolName}'s official digital yearbook hub on Yearbuk.
	•	OG image = cover photo or logo for previews.

⸻

TASK 2 — Search Tab (Viewer Dashboard)

New Route

/search

Add a dedicated Search tab to the viewer dashboard.

Design:
	•	Search bar at the top.
	•	Results displayed in cards showing:
	•	Logo
	•	School name
	•	Motto
	•	Clicking a result → routes to that school’s profile page via /schoolUsername.

Backend logic:
	•	Use debounce to limit request frequency.
	•	Match results by school name or username.

⸻

TASK 3 — Update Existing Search Behavior

The existing viewer dashboard search currently only displays results inline.
Change it so that when a result is clicked → user is routed to the full school profile page (/schoolUsername).

⸻

TASK 4 — Accessibility
	•	School profile pages should be accessible to everyone (even unregistered users).
	•	But restricted actions (like alumni request, yearbook viewing, or purchases) should prompt login/signup.
	•	Pages must be mobile-friendly, with a responsive layout for logos, banners, and buttons.
